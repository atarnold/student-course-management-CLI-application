## Description
The Student Course Management CLI Application is a command-line interface tool designed to help users manage students, courses, and enrollments. This application uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with a SQLite database. It features three tables with a one-to-many relationship and one table with a composite key, solving the real-world problem of organizing and tracking student enrollments in courses.
